The settings include configuring the Seaborn style to darkgrid for better visual contrast and readability, setting the Matplotlib style to dark_background for a visually appealing dark theme, setting the default float format in Pandas to display two decimal places, setting the maximum column width in Pandas to display the entire content without truncation, setting the display width in Pandas to match the terminal/console width, and resetting the column header justification in Pandas to its default (left-aligned). Additionally, the function sets the maximum number of rows to display to 400.\n"

    "Performs a text classification task using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to predict the programming language of a repository based on the contents of its README file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the code and the resulting classification report:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code starts by splitting the data into training and testing sets. The README content (df['Readme']) is used as the input features, and the corresponding programming language (df['Language']) is the target variable. The data is divided into 80% training set and 20% testing set.\n",
    "4-6. The TF-IDF vectorizer (TfidfVectorizer()) is created. This is a technique that converts text documents into numerical vectors, representing the importance of words in the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "8-9. The vectorizer is fitted on the training data (X_train) to learn the vocabulary and calculate the TF-IDF weights for the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "11-12. The testing data (X_test) is transformed using the fitted vectorizer, resulting in numerical vectors that represent the README contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "14-15. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier (SVC()) is created. SVM is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVM classifier is trained on the training data (X_train_vectors, y_train), where it learns patterns and relationships between the README contents and their corresponding programming languages.\n",
    "The trained SVM classifier is used to make predictions on the testing data (X_test_vectors).\n",
    "The classification_report function is called to generate a report that evaluates the performance of the classification. It calculates various metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each programming language. The zero_division=1 parameter is set to handle the case where a programming language has no predicted samples.\n",
    "The resulting classification report shows the performance metrics for each programming language. Precision represents the accuracy of the predictions for each language, recall measures the coverage of the predictions, and F1-score is a combination of precision and recall. The support column indicates the number of samples in the testing set for each language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the classification report shows the performance of the model in predicting the programming languages based on the README contents. The accuracy is given as 0.79, which means that the model predicted the correct programming language for 79% of the repositories in the testing set. The precision, recall, and F1-score values vary for different programming languages, indicating how well the model performs for each specific language. The macro avg and weighted avg values provide an overall evaluation of the model's performance across all languages."
