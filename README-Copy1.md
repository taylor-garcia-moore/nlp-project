# NLP Project

# Description

### This NLP project aims to build a model that can predict the main programming language of a GitHub repository based on the text of its README file. By analyzing the README files of different repositories, we will explore the data, preprocess it, and train machine learning models for accurate language prediction.

# Goals

### Acquire a dataset of README files from GitHub repositories. Preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis and modeling.Explore and visualize the data to gain insights and answer initial questions. Build and train machine learning models to predict the programming language of a repository based on its README. Evaluate the performance of the models and select the best-performing one. Provide recommendations and next steps based on the project findings.

# Initial Questions

### What are the most common words in README files?
### Does the length of the README vary by programming language?
### Do different programming languages use a different number of unique words?
### Are there any words that uniquely identify a programming language?

# Plan

## Data Acquisition:
### Determine a list of GitHub repositories to scrape README files from.
### Use web scraping techniques to acquire the data, considering popular repositories or repositories of specific interest.Document the source of the data, such as the top trending repositories on GitHub as of a specific date.

# Data Preparation:

### Clean the acquired data, removing irrelevant information or noise.
### Handle missing values and perform any necessary data transformations.
### Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
### Data Exploration:
### Analyze the data to identify the most common words in README files.
### Compare the length of README files across different programming languages.
### Calculate the number of unique words used in README files for each programming language.
### Identify any unique words that may indicate a specific programming language.


# Modeling:

### Transform the text data into a suitable format for machine learning models (e.g., bag of words, TF-IDF).
### Select and train different machine learning models, considering algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Random Forest.
### Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
### Conclusion and Recommendations:
### Summarize the findings and insights from the data exploration and modeling.
### Present the results through well-labeled visualizations in 2-5 Google Slides.
### Provide recommendations based on the model performance and insights gained.
### Outline next steps for further improvement or expansion of the project.
