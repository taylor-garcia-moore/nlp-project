This package currently ships with a `CallerLock` and a `RoleLock` \\n- `Caller`: An identity object that can have permissions to do something\\n- `Driver`: A storage system for permissions which can either be static or persistent\\n- `Permission`: A permission holds an action and an optional (unique) resource. Can be either a `Restriction` or a `Privilege`\\n- `Restriction`: A restriction denies you from being able to perform an action (on an optional resource)\\n- `Privilege`: A privilege allows you to perform an action (on an optional resource)\\n- `Action`: An action is something you are either allowed or denied to do\\n- `Resource`: A resource can be an object where you can perform one or more actions on. It can either target a certain type of resource or a specific resource by its unique identifier\\n- `Role`: A role can also hold multiple permissions. A caller can have multiple roles. Roles can inherit permissions from other roles\\n\\n## Features\\n\\n- Flexible acl permissions for multiple identities (callers)\\n- Static or persistent drivers to store permissions\\n- Action aliases\\n- Roles\\n- Conditions (Asserts)\\n- Easily implement acl functionality on your caller or role with a trait\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nLock differs from other acl packages by trying to provide the most flexible way for working with multiple permission callers and storing permissions.\\n\\nBy working with Lock\\'s `Caller` contract you can set permissions on multiple identities.\\n\\nThe `Driver` contract allows for an easy way to store permissions to a persistent or static storage system. A default static `ArrayDriver` ships with this package. Check out the list below for more drivers which have already been prepared for you. Or build your own by implementing the `Driver` contract.\\n\\nYou can set and check permissions for resources by manually passing along a resource\\'s type and (optional) identifier or you can implement the `Resource` contract onto your objects so you can pass them along to lock more easily.\\n\\nThe `Manager` allows for an easy way to instantiate new `Lock` instances, set action aliases or register roles.\\n\\n## Drivers\\n\\nIf you need a framework-specific implementation, pick one of the already prepared drivers below.\\n\\n- ArrayDriver (ships with this package)\\n- [Laravel 5](https://github.com/BeatSwitch/lock-laravel)\\n\\n## Roadmap\\n\\n- Group Permissions\\n- More drivers (Symfony, Zend Framework, Doctrine, ...)\\n- Event Listeners\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\nInstall this package through Composer.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ composer require beatswitch/lock\\n```\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\n### Implementing the Caller contract\\n\\nEvery identity which should have permissions to do something must implement the `BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Callers\\\\Caller` contract. The `Caller` contract identifies a caller by requiring it to return its type and its unique identifier. Let\\'s look at an example below.\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n\\nuse BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Callers\\\\Caller;\\n\\nclass User implements Caller\\n{\\n    public function getCallerType()\\n    {\\n        return \\'users\\';\\n    }\\n\\n    public function getCallerId()\\n    {\\n        return $this->id;\\n    }\\n\\n    public function getCallerRoles()\\n    {\\n        return [\\'editor\\', \\'publisher\\'];\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBy adding the `getCallerType` function we can identify a group of callers through a unique type. If we would at some point wanted to set permissions on another group of callers we could easily implement the contract on another object.\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n\\nuse BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Callers\\\\Caller;\\n\\nclass Organization implements Caller\\n{\\n    public function getCallerType()\\n    {\\n        return \\'organizations\\';\\n    }\\n\\n    public function getCallerId()\\n    {\\n        return $this->id;\\n    }\\n\\n    public function getCallerRoles()\\n    {\\n        return [\\'enterprise\\'];\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnd thus we can easily retrieve permissions for a specific caller type through a driver.\\n\\n### Working with a static driver\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to configure all of your permissions beforehand you can use the static `ArrayDriver` which ships with the package. This allows you to set a list of permissions for a caller before your application is run.\\n\\n```php\\nuse \\\\BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Drivers\\\\ArrayDriver;\\nuse \\\\BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Lock;\\nuse \\\\BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Manager;\\n\\n// Create a new Manager instance.\\n$manager = new Manager(new ArrayDriver());\\n\\n// Instantiate a new Lock instance for an object which implements the Caller contract.\\n$lock = $manager->caller($caller);\\n\\n// Set some permissions.\\n$lock->allow(\\'manage_settings\\');\\n$lock->allow(\\'create\\', \\'events\\');\\n\\n// Use the Lock instance to validate permissions on the given caller.\\n$lock->can(\\'manage_settings\\'); // true: can manage settings\\n$lock->can(\\'create\\', \\'events\\'); // true: can create events\\n$lock->cannot(\\'update\\', \\'events\\'); // true: cannot update events\\n$lock->can(\\'delete\\', \\'events\\'); // false: cannot delete events\\n```\\n\\n### Working with a persistent driver\\n\\nWorking with **a persistent driver** allows you to store permissions to a persistent storage layer and adjust them during runtime. For example, if you\\'d implement [the Laravel 5 driver](https://github.com/BeatSwitch/lock-laravel), it would store the permissions to a database using Laravel\\'s database component. By creating your own UI, you could easily attach the acl functionality from this package to create, for example, a user management system where different users have different permissions.\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at a very basic user management controller to see how that\\'s done. We\\'ll assume we get a bootstrapped lock manager instance with our Laravel DB driver.\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n\\nuse BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Manager;\\n\\nclass UserManagementController extends BaseController\\n{\\n    protected $lockManager;\\n\\n    public function __construct(Manager $lockManager)\\n    {\\n        $this->lockManager = $lockManager;\\n    }\\n\\n    public function togglePermission()\\n    {\\n        $userId = Input::get(\\'user\\');\\n        $action = Input::get(\\'action\\');\\n        $resource = Input::get(\\'resource\\');\\n\\n        $user = User::find($userId);\\n\\n        $this->lockManager->caller($user)->toggle($action, $resource);\\n\\n        return Redirect::route(\\'user_management\\');\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nEvery time the `togglePermission` method is used, the user\\'s permission for the given action and resource type will be toggled.\\n\\n### Setting and checking permissions\\n\\nYou can either `allow` or `deny` a caller from doing something. Here are a couple of ways to set and check permissions.\\n\\nAllow a caller to create everything.\\n\\n```php\\n$lock->allow(\\'create\\');\\n\\n$lock->can(\\'create\\'); // true\\n```\\n\\nAllow a caller to only create posts.\\n\\n```php\\n$lock->allow(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\');\\n\\n$lock->can(\\'create\\'); // false\\n$lock->can(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\'); // true\\n```\\n\\nAllow a caller to only edit a specific post with an ID of 5.\\n\\n```php\\n$lock->allow(\\'edit\\', \\'posts\\', 5);\\n\\n$lock->can(\\'edit\\'); // false\\n$lock->can(\\'edit\\', \\'posts\\'); // false\\n$lock->can(\\'edit\\', \\'posts\\', 5); // true\\n```\\n\\nAllow a caller to edit all posts but deny them from editing one with the id of 5.\\n\\n```php\\n$lock->allow(\\'edit\\', \\'posts\\');\\n$lock->deny(\\'edit\\', \\'posts\\', 5);\\n\\n$lock->can(\\'edit\\', \\'posts\\'); // true\\n$lock->can(\\'edit\\', \\'posts\\', 5); // false\\n```\\n\\nToggle a permission\\'s value.\\n\\n```php\\n$lock->allow(\\'create\\');\\n$lock->can(\\'create\\'); // true\\n\\n$lock->toggle(\\'create\\');\\n$lock->can(\\'create\\'); // false\\n```\\n\\nYou can allow or deny multiple actions at once and also check multiple actions at once.\\n\\n```php\\n$lock->allow([\\'create\\', \\'edit\\'], \\'posts\\');\\n\\n$lock->can(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\'); // true\\n$lock->can([\\'create\\', \\'edit\\'], \\'posts\\'); // true\\n$lock->can([\\'create\\', \\'delete\\'], \\'posts\\'); // false\\n```\\n\\n### Clearing permissions\\n\\nYou can easily clear permissions for a set specific combination of actions and resources.\\n\\n```php\\n$lock->allow([\\'create\\', \\'edit\\'], \\'posts\\');\\n\\n$lock->clear(\\'edit\\', \\'posts\\');\\n\\n$lock->can(\\'edit\\', \\'posts\\'); // false\\n$lock->can(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\'); // true\\n```\\n\\nYou can also just clear all permissions for a lock instance.\\n\\n```php\\n$lock->allow(\\'manage-posts\\');\\n$lock->allow([\\'create\\', \\'edit\\'], \\'users\\');\\n\\n$lock->clear();\\n\\n$lock->can(\\'manage-posts\\'); // false\\n$lock->can(\\'create\\', \\'users\\'); // false\\n```\\n\\n### Setting an action alias\\n\\nTo group multiple actions and set them all at once you might want to set an action alias.\\n\\n```php\\n$lock->alias(\\'manage\\', [\\'create\\', \\'read\\', \\'delete\\']);\\n$lock->allow(\\'manage\\', \\'posts\\');\\n\\n$lock->can(\\'manage\\', \\'posts\\'); // true\\n$lock->can(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\'); // true\\n$lock->can(\\'delete\\', \\'posts\\', 1); // true\\n$lock->can(\\'update\\', \\'posts\\'); // false\\n```\\n\\n### Setting a God caller\\n\\nYou could easily set a caller which has all permissions for everything by passing the `all` wildcard as an action on the lock instance.\\n\\n```php\\n$lock->allow(\\'all\\');\\n```\\n\\nNow every \"can\" method call will validate to true for this caller.\\n\\n### Working with roles\\n\\nLock provides an easy way to working with roles. You can work with roles out of the box but if you want to work with inheritance, you\\'ll need to register the roles to the manager instance.\\n\\n```php\\n$manager->setRole(\\'guest\\');\\n$manager->setRole(\\'user\\', \\'guest\\'); // \"user\" will inherit all permissions from \"guest\"\\n```\\n\\nOr register multiple roles at once.\\n\\n```php\\n$manager->setRole([\\'editor\\', \\'admin\\'], \\'user\\'); // \"editor\" and \"admin\" will inherit all permissions from \"user\".\\n```\\n\\nLet\\'s set some permissions and see how they are resolved.\\n\\n```php\\n// Allow a guest to read everything.\\n$manager->role(\\'guest\\')->allow(\\'guest\\', \\'read\\');\\n\\n// Allow a user to create posts.\\n$manager->role(\\'user\\')->allow(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\');\\n\\n// Allow an editor and admin to publish posts.\\n$manager->role(\\'editor\\')->allow(\\'publish\\', \\'posts\\');\\n$manager->role(\\'admin\\')->allow(\\'publish\\', \\'posts\\');\\n\\n// Allow an admin to delete posts.\\n$manager->role(\\'admin\\')->allow(\\'delete\\', \\'posts\\');\\n\\n// Let\\'s assume our caller has the role of \"editor\" and check some permissions.\\n$lock = $manager->caller($caller);\\n$lock->can(\\'read\\'); // true\\n$lock->can(\\'delete\\', \\'posts\\'); // false\\n$lock->can(\\'publish\\'); // false: we can\\'t publish everything, just posts.\\n$lock->can([\\'create\\', \\'publish\\'], \\'posts\\'); // true\\n```\\n\\nSomething you need to be aware of is that caller-level permissions supersede role-level permissions. Let\\'s see how that works.\\n\\nOur caller will have the user role.\\n\\n```php\\n$manager->caller($caller)->allow(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\');\\n\\n// Notice that we don\\'t need to set the role in the\\n// manager first if we don\\'t care about inheritance.\\n$manager->role(\\'user\\')->deny(\\'user\\', \\'create\\', \\'posts\\');\\n\\n$manager->caller($caller)->can(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\'); // true: the user has explicit permission to create posts.\\n```\\n\\n### Working with conditions\\n\\nConditions are actually asserts which are extra checks you can set for permissions. You can pass an array with them as the last parameter of `allow` and `deny`. All conditions must implement the `BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Permissions\\\\Condition` interface.\\n\\n> **Warning:** please note that conditions currently only work with static drivers.\\n\\nLet\\'s setup a condition.\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n\\nuse BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Lock;\\nuse BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Permissions\\\\Condition;\\nuse BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Permissions\\\\Permission;\\nuse BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Resources\\\\Resource;\\nuse Illuminate\\\\Auth\\\\AuthManager;\\n\\nclass LoggedInCondition implements Condition\\n{\\n    /**\\n     * The Laravel AuthManager instance\\n     *\\n     * @var \\\\Illuminate\\\\Auth\\\\AuthManager\\n     */\\n    protected $auth;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @param \\\\Illuminate\\\\Auth\\\\AuthManager $auth\\n     */\\n    public function __construct(AuthManager $auth)\\n    {\\n        $this->auth = $auth;\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * Assert if the condition is correct\\n     *\\n     * @param \\\\BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Lock $lock                         The current Lock instance that\\'s being used\\n     * @param \\\\BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Permissions\\\\Permission $permission The Permission that\\'s being checked\\n     * @param string $action                                      The action passed to the can or cannot method\\n     * @param \\\\BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Resources\\\\Resource|null $resource  The resource passed to the can or cannot method\\n     * @return bool\\n     */\\n    public function assert(Lock $lock, Permission $permission, $action, Resource $resource = null)\\n    {\\n        // Condition will succeed if the user is logged in.\\n        return $this->auth->check();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow let\\'s see how this will work when setting up a permission.\\n\\n```php\\n$condition = App::make(\\'LoggedInCondition\\');\\n\\n$lock->allow(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\', null, $condition);\\n$lock->can(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\'); // true if logged in, otherwise false.\\n```\\n\\nYou can also pass along multiple conditions.\\n\\n```php\\n$lock->allow(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\', null, [$falseCondition, $trueCondition]);\\n$lock->can(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\'); // false: there\\'s at least one false condition\\n```\\n\\nYou can pass along as many conditions as you like but they all need to succeed in order for the permission to work.\\n\\nYou can also use a callback if you like.\\n\\n```php\\n$lock->allow(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\', null, function ($lock, $permission, $action, $resource = null) {\\n    return false;\\n});\\n$lock->can(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\'); // false because the callback returns false.\\n```\\n\\n### Retrieving allowed or denied resources\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to retrieve a list of resources which are allowed or denied to perform a particularly action you can use the `allowed` and `denied` methods on a `Lock` instance.\\n\\n```php\\n$lock->allow(\\'update\\', \\'users\\', 1);\\n$lock->allow(\\'update\\', \\'users\\', 2);\\n$lock->allow(\\'update\\', \\'users\\', 3);\\n$lock->deny(\\'update\\', \\'users\\', 2);\\n\\n$lock->allowed(\\'update\\', \\'users\\'); // Returns [1, 3];\\n$lock->denied(\\'update\\', \\'users\\'); // Returns [2];\\n```\\n\\n> Please keep in mind that you can only retrieve id\\'s from resources which have permissions set. Resources which aren\\'t registered through Lock won\\'t be returned.\\n\\n### Using the LockAware trait\\n\\nYou can easily add acl functionality to your caller or role by implementing the `BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\LockAware` trait.\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n\\nuse BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Callers\\\\Caller;\\nuse BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\LockAware;\\n\\nclass Organization implements Caller\\n{\\n    use LockAware;\\n\\n    public function getCallerType()\\n    {\\n        return \\'organizations\\';\\n    }\\n\\n    public function getCallerId()\\n    {\\n        return $this->id;\\n    }\\n\\n    public function getCallerRoles()\\n    {\\n        return [\\'enterprise\\'];\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNow we need to set its lock instance.\\n\\n```php\\n$caller->setLock($lock);\\n```\\n\\nAnd now your caller can use all of the lock methods onto itself.\\n\\n```php\\n$caller->can(\\'create\\', \\'posts\\');\\n$caller->allow(\\'edit\\', \\'pages\\');\\n```\\n\\nIf you have a caller which implements the `LockAware` trait but haven\\'t bootstrapped the caller\\'s lock instance yet you can easily make the caller lock aware by using the manager\\'s `makeCallerLockAware` method.\\n\\n```php\\n$caller = $manager->makeCallerLockAware($caller);\\n```\\n\\nAnd now your caller will be able to use the `LockAware` methods. There\\'s a similar method for roles.\\n\\n```php\\n$role = $manager->makeRoleLockAware(\\'guest\\');\\n```\\n\\nThis will bootstrap a `SimpleRole` object which already comes with the `LockAware` trait in place.\\n\\n## Api\\n\\n### BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Lock\\n\\nThe following methods can all be called on a `BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Lock` instance.\\n\\n#### can\\n\\nChecks to see if the current caller has permission to do something.\\n\\n```\\ncan(\\n    string|array $action,\\n    string|\\\\BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Resources\\\\Resource $resource = null,\\n    int $resourceId = null\\n)\\n```\\n\\n#### cannot\\n\\nChecks to see if it\\'s forbidden for the current caller to do something.\\n\\n```\\ncannot(\\n    string|array $action,\\n    string|\\\\BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Resources\\\\Resource $resource = null,\\n    int $resourceId = null\\n)\\n```\\n\\n#### allow\\n\\nSets a `Privilege` permission on a caller to allow it to do something.

Below we\\'ll demonstrate how to create our own persistent driver using Laravel\\'s Eloquent ORM as our storage mechanism.\\n\\nWe\\'ll assume we have a `CallerPermission` model class with at least the following database columns:\\n\\n- `caller_type` (varchar, 100)\\n- `caller_id` (int, 11)\\n- `type` (varchar, 10)\\n- `action` (varchar, 100)\\n- `resource_type` (varchar, 100, nullable)\\n- `resource_id` (int, 11, nullable)\\n\\nAnd we have a `RolePermission` model with the following database columns:\\n\\n- `role` (varchar, 100)\\n- `type` (varchar, 10)\\n- `action` (varchar, 100)\\n- `resource_type` (varchar, 100, nullable)\\n- `resource_id` (int, 11, nullable)\\n\\nLet\\'s check out a full implementation of the driver below. Notice that for the `getCallerPermissions` method we\\'re using the `PermissionFactory` class to easily map the data and create `Permission` objects from them. The `PermissionFactory`\\'s `createFromData` method will accept both arrays and objects.\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n\\nuse BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Callers\\\\Caller;\\nuse

not checking if the permission already exists when we\\'re attempting to store it. You don\\'t need to worry about that because that\\'s all been done for you in the `Lock` instance.\\n\\nNow we have a driver which supports storing of permissions for callers and roles.\\n\\n### Testing your driver\\n\\nIt\\'s very easy for you to make sure your driver works as expected. If you\\'re building a persistent driver you can easily test it by creating a PHPUnit test which extends the `PersistentDriverTestCase` class.\\n\\n```php\\n<?php\\n\\nuse BeatSwitch\\\\Lock\\\\Tests\\\\PersistentDriverTestCase;\\n\\nclass EloquentDriverTest extends PersistentDriverTestCase\\n{\\n    public function setUp()\\n    {\\n        // Don\\'t forget to reset your DB here.\\n        \\n        // Bootstrap your driver.\\n        $this->driver = new EloquentDriver();\\n\\n        parent::setUp();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAnd this is all you need! The `PersistentDriverTestCase` contains all the tests you\\'ll need to make sure your driver works as expected. So if all those tests pass then your driver was set up correctly. No need to mock anything, this is a pure integration test case. Of course in this specific example above, for Eloquent to work you\\'ll need to bootstrap Laravel. Working with a database like sqlite would be the best way here to test your driver. \\n\\n## Maintainer\\n\\n> Lock is unmaintained at this moment.\\n\\nThis package is currently maintained by [Dries Vints](https://github.com/driesvints).  \\nIf you have any questions please don\\'t hesitate to [ask them in an issue](https://github.com/BeatSwitch/lock/issues/new).\\n\\n## Contributing\\n\\nPlease see [the contributing file](contributing.md) for details.\\n\\n## Changelog\\n\\nYou can see a list of changes for each release in [our changelog file](changelog.md).\\n\\n## License\\n\\nThe MIT License.

caller an identity object that can have permissions to do something  driver a storage system for permissions which can either be static or persistent  permission a permission holds an action and an optional unique resource can be either a restriction or a privilege  restriction a restriction denies you from being able to perform an action on an optional resource  privilege a privilege allows you to perform an action on an optional resource  action an action is something you are either allowed or denied to do  resource a resource can be an object where you can perform one or more actions on it can either target a certain type of resource or a specific resource by its unique identifier  role a role can also hold multiple permissions a caller can have multiple roles roles can inherit permissions from other roles   features   flexible acl permissions for multiple identities callers  static or persistent drivers to store permissions  action aliases  roles  conditions asserts  easily implement acl functionality on your caller or role with a trait   introduction  lock differs from other acl packages by trying to provide the most flexible way for working with multiple permission callers and storing permissions  by working with lock's caller contract you can set permissions on multiple identities  the driver contract allows for an easy way to store permissions to a persistent or static storage system a default static arraydriver ships with this package check out the list below for more drivers which have already been prepared for you or build your own by implementing the driver contract  you can set and check permissions for resources by manually passing along a resource's type and optional identifier or you can implement the resource contract onto your objects so you can pass them along to lock more easily  the manager allows for an easy way to instantiate new lock instances set action aliases or register roles   drivers  if you need a frameworkspecific implementation pick one of the already prepared drivers below   arraydriver ships with this package  laravel 5    roadmap   group permissions  more drivers symfony zend framework doctrine   event listeners   installation  install this package through composer  bash  composer require beatswitchlock    usage   implementing the caller contract  every identity which should have permissions to do something must implement the beatswitchlockcallerscaller contract the caller contract identifies a caller by requiring it to return its type and its unique identifier let's look at an example below  php php  use beatswitchlockcallerscaller  class user implements caller      public function getcallertype              return 'users'           public function getcallerid              return thisid           public function getcallerroles              return 'editor' 'publisher'         by adding the getcallertype function we can identify a group of callers through a unique type if we would at some point wanted to set permissions on another group of callers we could easily implement the contract on another object  php php  use beatswitchlockcallerscaller  class organization implements caller      public function getcallertype              return 'organizations'           public function getcallerid              return thisid           public function getcallerroles              return 'enterprise'         and thus we can easily retrieve permissions for a specific caller type through a driver   working with a static driver  if you'd like to configure all of your permissions beforehand you can use the static arraydriver which ships with the package this allows you to set a list of permissions for a caller before your application is run  php use beatswitchlockdriversarraydriver use beatswitchlocklock use beatswitchlockmanager   create a new manager instance manager  new managernew arraydriver   instantiate a new lock instance for an object which implements the caller contract lock  managercallercaller   set some permissions lockallow'managesettings' lockallow'create' 'events'   use the lock instance to validate permissions on the given caller lockcan'managesettings'  true can manage settings lockcan'create' 'events'  true can create events lockcannot'update' 'events'  true cannot update events lockcan'delete' 'events'  false cannot delete events    working with a persistent driver  working with a persistent driver allows you to store permissions to a persistent storage layer and adjust them during runtime for example if you'd implement the laravel 5 driver  it would store the permissions to a database using laravel's database component by creating your own ui you could easily attach the acl functionality from this package to create for example a user management system where different users have different permissions  let's take a look at a very basic user management controller to see how that's done we'll assume we get a bootstrapped lock manager instance with our laravel db driver  php php  use beatswitchlockmanager  class usermanagementcontroller extends basecontroller      protected lockmanager      public function constructmanager lockmanager              thislockmanager  lockmanager           public function togglepermission              userid  inputget'user'         action  inputget'action'         resource  inputget'resource'          user  userfinduserid          thislockmanagercallerusertoggleaction resource          return redirectroute'usermanagement'         every time the togglepermission method is used the user's permission for the given action and resource type will be toggled   setting and checking permissions  you can either allow or deny a caller from doing something here are a couple of ways to set and check permissions  allow a caller to create everything  php lockallow'create'  lockcan'create'  true   allow a caller to only create posts  php lockallow'create' 'posts'  lockcan'create'  false lockcan'create' 'posts'  true   allow a caller to only edit a specific post with an id of 5  php lockallow'edit' 'posts' 5  lockcan'edit'  false lockcan'edit' 'posts'  false lockcan'edit' 'posts' 5  true   allow a caller to edit all posts but deny them from editing one with the id of 5  php lockallow'edit' 'posts' lockdeny'edit' 'posts' 5  lockcan'edit' 'posts'  true lockcan'edit' 'posts' 5  false   toggle a permission's value  php lockallow'create' lockcan'create'  true  locktoggle'create' lockcan'create'  false   you can allow or deny multiple actions at once and also check multiple actions at once  php lockallow'create' 'edit' 'posts'  lockcan'create' 'posts'  true lockcan'create' 'edit' 'posts'  true lockcan'create' 'delete' 'posts'  false    clearing permissions  you can easily clear permissions for a set specific combination of actions and resources  php lockallow'create' 'edit' 'posts'  lockclear'edit' 'posts'  lockcan'edit' 'posts'  false lockcan'create' 'posts'  true   you can also just clear all permissions for a lock instance  php lockallow'manageposts' lockallow'create' 'edit' 'users'  lockclear  lockcan'manageposts'  false lockcan'create' 'users'  false    setting an action alias  to group multiple actions and set them all at once you might want to set an action alias  php lockalias'manage' 'create' 'read' 'delete' lockallow'manage' 'posts'  lockcan'manage' 'posts'  true lockcan'create' 'posts'  true lockcan'delete' 'posts' 1  true lockcan'update' 'posts'  false    setting a god caller  you could easily set a caller which has all permissions for everything by passing the all wildcard as an action on the lock instance  php lockallow'all'   now every can method call will validate to true for this caller   working with roles  lock provides an easy way to working with roles you can work with roles out of the box but if you want to work with inheritance you'll need to register the roles to the manager instance  php managersetrole'guest' managersetrole'user' 'guest'  user will inherit all permissions from guest   or register multiple roles at once  php managersetrole'editor' 'admin' 'user'  editor and admin will inherit all permissions from user   let's set some permissions and see how they are resolved  php  allow a guest to read everything managerrole'guest'allow'guest' 'read'   allow a user to create posts managerrole'user'allow'create' 'posts'   allow an editor and admin to publish posts managerrole'editor'allow'publish' 'posts' managerrole'admin'allow'publish' 'posts'   allow an admin to delete posts managerrole'admin'allow'delete' 'posts'   let's assume our caller has the role of editor and check some permissions lock  managercallercaller lockcan'read'  true lockcan'delete' 'posts'  false lockcan'publish'  false we can't publish everything just posts lockcan'create' 'publish' 'posts'  true   something you need to be aware of is that callerlevel permissions supersede rolelevel permissions let's see how that works  our caller will have the user role  php managercallercallerallow'create' 'posts'   notice that we don't need to set the role in the  manager first if we don't care about inheritance managerrole'user'deny'user' 'create' 'posts'  managercallercallercan'create' 'posts'  true the user has explicit permission to create posts    working with conditions  conditions are actually asserts which are extra checks you can set for permissions you can pass an array with them as the last parameter of allow and deny all conditions must implement the beatswitchlockpermissionscondition interface   warning please note that conditions currently only work with static drivers  let's setup a condition  php php  use beatswitchlocklock use beatswitchlockpermissionscondition use beatswitchlockpermissionspermission use beatswitchlockresourcesresource use illuminateauthauthmanager  class loggedincondition implements condition             the laravel authmanager instance             var illuminateauthauthmanager           protected auth             param illuminateauthauthmanager auth           public function constructauthmanager auth              thisauth  auth                  assert if the condition is correct             param beatswitchlocklock lock                         the current lock instance that's being used       param beatswitchlockpermissionspermission permission the permission that's being checked       param string action                                      the action passed to the can or cannot method       param beatswitchlockresourcesresourcenull resource  the resource passed to the can or cannot method       return bool           public function assertlock lock permission permission action resource resource  null               condition will succeed if the user is logged in         return thisauthcheck         now let's see how this will work when setting up a permission  php condition  appmake'loggedincondition'  lockallow'create' 'posts' null condition lockcan'create' 'posts'  true if logged in otherwise false   you can also pass along multiple conditions  php lockallow'create' 'posts' null falsecondition truecondition lockcan'create' 'posts'  false there's at least one false condition   you can pass along as many conditions as you like but they all need to succeed in order for the permission to work  you can also use a callback if you like  php lockallow'create' 'posts' null function lock permission action resource  null      return false  lockcan'create' 'posts'  false because the callback returns false    retrieving allowed or denied resources  if you'd like to retrieve a list of resources which are allowed or denied to perform a particularly action you can use the allowed and denied methods on a lock instance  php lockallow'update' 'users' 1 lockallow'update' 'users' 2 lockallow'update' 'users' 3 lockdeny'update' 'users' 2  lockallowed'update' 'users'  returns 1 3 lockdenied'update' 'users'  returns 2    please keep in mind that you can only retrieve id's from resources which have permissions set resources which aren't registered through lock won't be returned   using the lockaware trait  you can easily add acl functionality to your caller or role by implementing the beatswitchlocklockaware trait  php php  use beatswitchlockcallerscaller use beatswitchlocklockaware  class organization implements caller      use lockaware      public function getcallertype              return 'organizations'           public function getcallerid              return thisid           public function getcallerroles              return 'enterprise'         now we need to set its lock instance  php callersetlocklock   and now your caller can use all of the lock methods onto itself  php callercan'create' 'posts' callerallow'edit' 'pages'   if you have a caller which implements the lockaware trait but haven't bootstrapped the caller's lock instance yet you can easily make the caller lock aware by using the manager's makecallerlockaware method  php caller  managermakecallerlockawarecaller   and now your caller will be able to use the lockaware methods there's a similar method for roles  php role  managermakerolelockaware'guest'   this will bootstrap a simplerole object which already comes with the lockaware trait in place   api   beatswitchlocklock  the following methods can all be called on a beatswitchlocklock instance   can  checks to see if the current caller has permission to do something   can     stringarray action     stringbeatswitchlockresourcesresource resource  null     int resourceid  null     cannot  checks to see if it's forbidden for the current caller to do something   cannot     stringarray action

  stringarray action     stringbeatswitchlockresourcesresource resource  null     int resourceid  null     beatswitchlockpermissionscondition conditions       deny  sets a restriction permission on a caller to prevent it from doing something removes any matching privileges   deny     stringarray action     stringbeatswitchlockresourcesresource resource  null     int resourceid  null     beatswitchlockpermissionscondition conditions       toggle  toggles the value for the given permission   toggle     stringarray action     stringbeatswitchlockresourcesresource resource  null     int resourceid  null     allowed  returns all the id's in an array of the given resource type to which the subject is allowed to perform the given action on   allowed     stringarray action

stringarray action     stringbeatswitchlockresourcesresource resourcetype     beatswitchlockmanager  the following methods can all be called on a beatswitchlockmanager instance   caller  returns a beatswitchlocklock instance for a caller   caller     beatswitchlockcallerscaller caller     role  returns a beatswitchlocklock instance for a role   role     beatswitchlockrolesrole role     alias  add an alias for one or more actions   alias     string name     stringarray actions     setrole  set one or more roles and an optional role to inherit permissions from   setrole     stringarray name     string inherit  null     makecallerlockaware  sets the lock instance for a caller which implements the lockaware trait returns the caller with the lock instance set   makecallerlockaware     beatswitchlockcallerscaller caller     makerolelockaware  sets the lock instance for a role which implements the lockaware trait returns the role with the lock instance set   makerolelockaware     beatswitchlockrolesrolestring role     building a driver  you can easily build a driver by implementing the beatswitchlockdriversdriver contract below we'll demonstrate how to create our own persistent driver using laravel's eloquent orm as our storage mechanism  we'll assume we have a callerpermission model class with at least the following database columns   callertype varchar 100  callerid int 11  type varchar 10  action varchar 100  resourcetype varchar 100 nullable  resourceid int 11 nullable  and we have a rolepermission model with the following database columns   role varchar 100  type varchar 10  action varchar 100  resourcetype varchar 100 nullable  resourceid int 11 nullable  let's check out a full implementation of the driver below notice that for the getcallerpermissions method we're using the permissionfactory class to easily map the data and create permission objects from them the permissionfactory's createfromdata method will accept both arrays and objects  php php  use beatswitchlockcallerscaller use beatswitchlockdriversdriver use beatswitchlockpermissionspermission use beatswitchlockpermissionspermissionfactory use beatswitchlockrolesrole

where'resourcetype' permissiongetresourcetype             where'resourceid' permissiongetresourceid             first         notice that we're not checking if the permission already exists when we're attempting to store it you don't need to worry about that because that's all been done for you in the lock instance  now we have a driver which supports storing of permissions for callers and roles   testing your driver  it's very easy for you to make sure your driver works as expected if you're building a persistent driver you can easily test it by creating a phpunit test which extends the persistentdrivertestcase class  php php  use beatswitchlocktestspersistentdrivertestcase  class eloquentdrivertest extends persistentdrivertestcase      public function setup               don't forget to reset your db here                   bootstrap your driver         thisdriver  new eloquentdriver          parentsetup         and this is all you need the persistentdrivertestcase contains all the tests you'll need to make sure your driver works as expected so if all those tests pass then your driver was set up correctly no need to mock anything this is a pure integration test case of course in this specific example above for eloquent to work you'll need to bootstrap laravel working with a database like sqlite would be the best way here to test your driver    maintainer   lock is
